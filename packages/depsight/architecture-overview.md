# Architecture Overview: depsight

## Recommended Starting Point

Start with modular monolith as the default architecture.

Recommended option: option-a

## Reasons

- This option offers the best balance between delivery speed and long-term maintainability.
- It avoids premature distributed complexity while keeping room for future extraction.

## Architecture Options

## Lean Modular Monolith

Shape: modular monolith

One deployable application with explicit domain modules and a single primary data store.

### Scores

- Delivery speed: 5/5
- Operational simplicity: 5/5
- Scalability headroom: 4/5
- Governance fit: 4/5

### Strengths

- Fastest path to a coherent first release.
- Lowest coordination and deployment overhead.
- Strong fit for small teams.

### Tradeoffs

- Harder to isolate workloads if scale diverges later.
- Governance boundaries rely more on discipline than on topology.

## Modular Monolith With Background Jobs

Shape: modular monolith with background jobs

Single primary deployable unit with explicit modules plus a worker path for async workflows and integrations.

### Scores

- Delivery speed: 4/5
- Operational simplicity: 4/5
- Scalability headroom: 4/5
- Governance fit: 4/5

### Strengths

- Balances fast delivery with explicit async workflow support.
- Keeps the system operable without early service sprawl.
- Supports clearer control points for integrations and audit workflows.

### Tradeoffs

- Slightly more moving parts than a pure monolith.
- Still requires later extraction if independent scaling becomes dominant.

## Early Service Separation

Shape: small service-oriented split

Separate user-facing application, workflow engine, and integration boundary early for stronger isolation.

### Scores

- Delivery speed: 2/5
- Operational simplicity: 2/5
- Scalability headroom: 5/5
- Governance fit: 3/5

### Strengths

- Stronger hard boundaries for scaling and ownership.
- Can align better with strict isolation or governance requirements.

### Tradeoffs

- Higher delivery and operational cost from the start.
- Adds distributed failure modes before the product is proven.

## Likely Modules

- user-facing application surface
- domain and business logic modules
- persistence and integration modules
- background processing where workflows or notifications require it

## Integrations

- None

## Risks

- None
