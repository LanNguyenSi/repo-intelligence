# Prompt: Architecture Analysis

You are working on `depsight`.

## Objective

Validate and refine the recommended architecture for this project.
Use a spec/context/eval lens:

- spec: check that the architecture matches the intended scope and constraints
- context: use the project domain, integrations, security posture, and operating assumptions directly
- eval: call out the evidence and checks needed to validate the recommendation later

## Context

- Summary: GitHub-connected developer security dashboard for tracking CVEs, license risks, and dependency health across repositories — with timelines, risk scores, and compliance export.
- Planner profile: product
- Phase: phase_1
- Path: core
- Recommended architecture: Start with modular monolith as the default architecture.

## Architecture Options

- option-a: Lean Modular Monolith (modular monolith)
  Summary: One deployable application with explicit domain modules and a single primary data store.
  Scores: delivery=5, ops=5, scale=4, governance=4
- option-b: Modular Monolith With Background Jobs (modular monolith with background jobs)
  Summary: Single primary deployable unit with explicit modules plus a worker path for async workflows and integrations.
  Scores: delivery=4, ops=4, scale=4, governance=4
- option-c: Early Service Separation (small service-oriented split)
  Summary: Separate user-facing application, workflow engine, and integration boundary early for stronger isolation.
  Scores: delivery=2, ops=2, scale=5, governance=3
