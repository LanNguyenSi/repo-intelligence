# Prompt: Intake Clarification

You are working on `depsight`.

## Objective

Clarify the missing planning inputs before deeper architecture and task execution begins.

## Intake Status

- Completeness: partial

## Questions To Resolve

- Q-005 (medium, blocker): What non-functional expectations matter most: performance, availability, security, auditability, or scalability?
  Why: Non-functional requirements influence architecture scoring and production readiness.
- Q-006 (medium): Are there external integrations, identity providers, or messaging systems the product must rely on?
  Why: Integrations change failure modes, security assumptions, and delivery scope.
