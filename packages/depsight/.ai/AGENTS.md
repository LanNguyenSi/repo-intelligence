# Agents

## Team

| Role | Name | Scope | Permissions |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| Engineering Lead | [assign] | architecture, review, release | full |
| AI Agent | [assign] | implementation, tests, docs | tier-2 (commit, PR — no deploy) |

## Permissions

### Tier 1 — Autonomous (no confirmation needed)
- Read code and documentation
- Generate drafts (code, tests, docs)
- Run local tests and linters

### Tier 2 — Assisted (human review required)
- Create commits and pull requests
- Modify database schema or migrations
- Change auth or security code
- Update `.ai/` context files

### Tier 3 — Prohibited
- Deploy to production
- Approve own pull requests
- Delete production data
- Disable security controls or monitoring
- Force-push to main

## Workflow

1. Tasks are defined in `.ai/TASKS.md` with clear acceptance criteria.
2. Agent creates branch: `feat/<task-id>-<short-name>`
3. Agent implements, commits with `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
4. Agent opens PR — human reviews before merge.
5. Human deploys to production.

## Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- Database mutations in transactions when modifying related data
- `force-dynamic` export on all pages with DB queries
- De UI strings, English code and comments
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- PR attribution: include `Co-Authored-By` for agent contributions

## What Agents Must Not Do

- Deploy to production without human sign-off
- Modify CI/CD or Docker config without explicit task assignment
- Change auth logic (lib/auth.ts) without review
- Skip linting or test runs
- Merge their own PRs

## File Conventions

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `app/(public)/` | Public-facing pages |
| `app/admin/` | Admin panel pages |
| `app/api/` | API routes |
| `components/` | UI components (public/, admin/, shared/) |
| `lib/` | Utilities, DB client, auth |
| `prisma/` | Database schema + migrations |
| `.ai/` | Agent context files (this folder) |
