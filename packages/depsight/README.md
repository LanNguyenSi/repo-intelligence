# depsight

GitHub-connected developer security dashboard for tracking CVEs, license risks, and dependency health across repositories.

**Live Demo:** [depsight.opentriologue.ai](https://depsight.opentriologue.ai/)

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma ORM
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Auth:** NextAuth v5 (GitHub OAuth + Dev Credentials)
- **Deployment:** Docker (multi-stage build)

## Features

- GitHub OAuth login and repository discovery
- CVE scanning per repository (severity breakdown, risk scores)
- License detection and copyleft compliance checking
- Dependency age tracking and outdated alerts
- Multi-ecosystem support: **npm, Python, Go, Java, Rust, PHP**
- Vulnerability timeline and risk score history
- Cross-repo comparison and team health overview
- SBOM export (CycloneDX 1.4 format)
- Policy engine for custom CVE/license rules
- PR integration with automatic CVE comments
- Webhook and Slack notifications
- **CI Health** — workflow fail rates, build times, flaky job detection (powered by [ci-insights](https://github.com/LanNguyenSi/ci-insights))

## CI Health Tab

The **CI Health** tab shows GitHub Actions analytics (fail rates, build times, flaky jobs) powered by **[ci-insights](https://github.com/LanNguyenSi/ci-insights)** — a companion service that syncs and stores workflow data from GitHub Actions.

> **The tab is only visible once CI data has been synced.**

### Setup

1. Deploy [ci-insights](https://github.com/LanNguyenSi/ci-insights) and configure your GitHub token
2. Run a sync for the repository
3. The CI Health tab will appear automatically in depsight once data is available

To trigger a sync manually via the depsight API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-depsight>/api/ci/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repoId": "<repo-id>"}'
```

> **depsight works fully without ci-insights** — the CI Health tab simply won't appear if no data has been synced.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Single command — installs deps, starts DB, migrates, runs dev server
make dev
```

This starts the full Docker environment (app + PostgreSQL). Access at **http://localhost:3000**.

In development, a **Dev Login** is available on the login page — no GitHub OAuth credentials needed.

### With GitHub OAuth (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
make dev
```

### Other Make targets

```bash
make dev-up      # Start in background
make dev-down    # Stop
make dev-logs    # Tail logs
make dev-clean   # Stop + delete DB volumes
make prod        # Production build + start
make test        # Run tests
make lint        # Linting + type-checking
make ci          # Full CI pipeline
```

### Database Management

```bash
# These run inside the Docker container automatically on `make dev`.
# For manual use:
npm run db:generate    # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:push        # Push schema changes (dev)
npm run db:studio      # Database GUI
```
