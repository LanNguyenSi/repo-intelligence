## Summary

Capture the product scope, users, constraints, architecture shape, and open questions.

## Problem

The project starts from rough requirements and needs a shared baseline before implementation can be reviewed or sequenced safely.

## Solution

Create the charter, architecture overview, and first ADRs so later execution work inherits explicit assumptions instead of guesswork.

## Files To Create Or Modify

- PROJECT.md
- project-charter.md
- architecture-overview.md
- adrs/001-initial-architecture-shape.md
- adrs/002-primary-data-store.md

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The charter captures summary, users, features, constraints, and unresolved questions.
- [ ] The architecture overview names a recommended starting shape and its tradeoffs.
- [ ] Initial ADRs exist for the highest-leverage early decisions.

## Implementation Notes

- Use the recommended architecture as the default, not as a final truth claim.
- Keep open questions visible so downstream agents know what may still change.
- Reference the applicable playbooks directly in the generated charter.
