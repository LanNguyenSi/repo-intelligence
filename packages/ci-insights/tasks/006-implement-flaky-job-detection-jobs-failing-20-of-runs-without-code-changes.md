## Summary

Design and implement the capability for: Flaky job detection: jobs failing >20% of runs without code changes.

## Problem

The product cannot satisfy its initial scope until Flaky job detection: jobs failing >20% of runs without code changes exists as a reviewable, testable capability.

## Solution

Add a focused module for Flaky job detection: jobs failing >20% of runs without code changes that matches the recommended modular monolith and keeps integration boundaries explicit.

## Implementation Notes

- Start from domain rules and access constraints before UI or transport details.
- Keep module boundaries explicit so later extraction remains possible if the system grows.
- Update docs and tests in the same change instead of leaving them for cleanup.
