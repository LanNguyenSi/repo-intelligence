## Blocks

## Summary

Verify the critical path, failure handling, and integration boundaries with tests.

## Problem

The initial implementation backlog leaves room for silent regressions unless critical-path and error-path coverage are added deliberately.

## Solution

Add end-to-end and integration-focused verification around the user path, external boundaries, and failure handling assumptions.

## Files To Create Or Modify

- tests/integration/critical-path.test.js
- tests/integration/error-handling.test.js
- tests/contract/integrations.test.js

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Critical path behavior is exercised through automated tests.
- [ ] Integration and error paths fail loudly instead of degrading silently.
- [ ] Known edge cases from the first release plan are captured in test coverage.

## Implementation Notes

- Bias toward tests that exercise contracts and failure semantics, not only happy-path rendering.
- Keep fixtures readable so future backlog work can extend them safely.
