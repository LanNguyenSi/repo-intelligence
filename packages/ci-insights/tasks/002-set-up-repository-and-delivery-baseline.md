## Summary

Create the repository structure, quality checks, and basic documentation needed for implementation.

## Problem

Execution work will fragment quickly if the repository, quality gates, and documentation expectations are not defined up front.

## Solution

Establish the test path, delivery workflow expectations, and starter documentation before feature branches accumulate drift.

## Files To Create Or Modify

- package.json
- README.md
- tests/
- .github/workflows/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A repeatable local test command exists for the project baseline.
- [ ] Core delivery expectations are documented for humans and agents.
- [ ] The repository has enough structure that the first implementation wave can begin without setup churn.

## Implementation Notes

- Keep the baseline minimal but reviewable.
- Prefer a small number of reliable checks over aspirational tooling that nobody runs.
- Align branch and review behavior with the development workflow playbook.
